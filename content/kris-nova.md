## Her Passion

She is a **self-taught engineer** who experienced first hand the hardship of succeeding in STEM with a broken body.

Growing up in an environment blind to transgender youth healthcare, she **suffered unnecessary** irreversible physical and emotional damage.

She hopes to offer a brighter future for future minds in her field of work.

Ultimately she believes 

 > that a brilliant mind should never be held back by an unsafe body.

## Her Struggle 

Never graduating from college, and competing in a **male dominated industry** presented plenty of challenges for **queer** Nóva.

Furthermore, her body had **unnecessarily developed** in ways that were actively harming her, causing an ever present risk of **self harm**.

After battling **private healthcare** companies for years, and paying well over 6 figures in out-of-pocket expenses she found herself **repulsed** with the current state of affairs with **transgender healthcare** in the U.S.

The amount of money, luck, and work required to merely achieve **minimal healthcare** was unacceptable to her.

## Her Goal

The year 2020 was challenging for humanity for so many reasons, and she was no exception to the hardship.

She decided to **roll up her sleeves** and dedicate a substantial portion of her personal time to offering a service to the world free of charge.

She has one simple goal.

 > To work towards a world where a transgender mind is never held back because of an unsafe body.
 
...and both her mind -- and her body -- have a lot of work to do.
