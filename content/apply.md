We take sponsorships seriously and so should you.

If you haven't already found [a member](https://github.com/privilegeescalation/membership) it is a good idea to identify one first.

Members usually hang out [on discord](https://discord.gg/bnnpg6rqaJ).

You should also have a good idea of what you need, why you can't get it, and what you would do if you were given it.
