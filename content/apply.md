We take this **extremely** seriously, and you should too.

Spending time and putting thought into your submission will let us know how serious you are about the sponsorship.

### You should have

 - A clear idea of what you need (_money, surgery, medicine, support, a plan, etc_ )
 - A clear reason why you need it (_we know transgender health care is hard - however do mention it!_ )
 - A clear vision of what would change if you had what you needed.
 - A realistic expectation that you may not be accepted.
 - A determined spirit. We can't do this for you. You can't give up.

We are doing all we can.
