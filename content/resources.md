Our dream is to enable gender confirming **healthcare**, **financial resources**, and **overall support** for transgender minds in **STEM**.

We identify determined minds in STEM who are currently **blocked** from reaching their full potential.

## Healthcare üè•

Are you **transgender**? Are you **queer**? Are you **fed up** and **traumatized** from an absence of healthcare?

Do you **know what you need** to be the best version of **you** you can be?

Is **healthcare** standing in the way between you are your **dreams**?

Would the **future version** of yourself happily **write the check** üí∞ you need?

Do you **need the surgery** in order to become the person who can **afford the surgery**?

Would it be easier to put your **mind** to work -- if only your **body** would cooperate?

Do you just **need help** -- but you can't **afford** it? 

Would you be willing to go **above and beyond** to get help **today**?

## üß† Knowledge

Are you overwhelmed with **private healthcare** in the U.S?

Have you found yourself learning more about **pre-authorization**, **rejected claims**, and **gatekeeping** than you dreamed possible? 

Do you feel like the only way to get even a **fraction of what you need** is to **hack** the system?

Would you like to **learn** from others?

Would you like to **share** what you learned the hard way?

Fundamentally we believe that **collaboration** is more effective than **competition**.

Sharing knowledge, experiences, and techniques is equally valuable as donating financially.
