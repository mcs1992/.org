Our dream is to enable gender confirming **healthcare**, **financial resources**, and **overall support** for transgender minds in **STEM**.

We identify determined minds in STEM who are currently **blocked** from reaching their full potential.

## Healthcare üè•

Are you **transgender**? Are you **queer**? Are you **fed up** and **traumatized** from an absence of healthcare?

Do you **know what you need** to be the best version of **you** you can be?

Is **healthcare** standing in the way between you are your **dreams**?

Would the **future version** of yourself happily write the check you need?

Do you need **the surgery** in order to become the person who can **afford** the surgery?

Would it be easier to put your **mind** to work -- if only your **body** would cooperate?

We should talk.
