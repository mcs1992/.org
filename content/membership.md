Membership is the core of The Privilege Escalation Foundation, and our **members** are leaders.

{{< quote "The entire system will be held together by a set of volunteer empathetic and honest members. Without good members we are nothing more than a website and a small bank account." "Kris Nóva" "/kris-nova">}}

---

Members are the volunteers like **you** who will be voting on how we spend our money.

Members will be expected to work directly with candidates to help them get the resources they need.

Being a member will not be easy, but it will always be free and rewarding.

### Is membership right for me?

Do you have a small amount of free time with a passion for helping transgender minds in STEM?

Are you empathetic and are willing to connect with people online?

Are you willing to find a candidate and stop at nothing until they receive the help they need?

Membership might be right for you.

### Who can be a member?

Anyone. 

Regardless of age, country of origin, citizenship, race, color, sexual orientation, background, religious status.

There are no limitations on who can be a member. 

### How do I apply?

There isn't an application however we use a tool called [GitHub](https://github.com) for now to manage the process. 

You can [read the fine print](https://github.com/privilegeescalation/membership/blob/main/README.md#how-to-become-a-member) about the process of becoming a member.

Also please do [talk to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/bnnpg6rqaJ) directly about becoming a member.

### Who appoints the first members? 

[Kris Nóva](/kris-nova) will officially appoint the first members to the foundation. 

The foundation will not be able to award any sponsorships until these original 3 members are appointed.

### What can members do?

The sky is the limit! 

However the majority of the job will require hanging out in Discord and voting every once in a while.

There is minimal structure in place today, but members will have total control of things like: 

 - Voting and elections
 - The sponsorship process
 - How a sponsorship is determined
 - How membership is managed
 - How the election process is managed

A **good** member will feel enabled to do things like:

 - Form committees 
 - Form subprojects
 - Design a fair election process
 - Edit the website
 - Post blogs
 - Help candidates
 - Help other members
 - Take ownership
